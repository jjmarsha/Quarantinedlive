## Overview

Welcome to our open source community. 

[Quarantined.live](http://quarantined.live) is a web application created during the current  Covid-19 outbreak. It has one mission: to facilitate conversations between people around the world around the subjects that matter to humanity. 

It is built on the .NET stack due to its scalability and reliability, as we seek to create an application that can be used daily by millions. Due to the urgency of the outbreak, we have decided to make the project open source in order to speed up development and improve security.

## What does it do?

[Quarantined.live](http://quarantined.live) version 0 works as a searchable directory for online calls and events.

We have noticed that many people are sharing links for video calls and webinars for anything from online education, concerts, business conferences, o scientific panels, and government broadcasts.

However, there is currently no way to find and discover these events unless one is on their email list or their follower on social media.

[Quarantine.live](http://quarantine.live) allows people to discover calls and events by searching for a specific topic or category and to quickly join them. 

Users can post their own video calls and webinars for other users to discover. Each entry contains the link to the call (ie. Zoom or Instagram), time of the call, name of the discussion, name of the host, tags for the topic, language, and type of content (video call or webinar).

## How can I participate?

At the moment you are reading this we will likely have launched our V0. V0 is a barebones app that lacks many standard features like user authentication and saving content.

We need your help making sure that what we are building is safe from hackers and trolls. Please report and help us fix vulnerabilities.

The Covid-19 outbreak has been used for phishing and other scandals. We also need your help to detect bad links and to filter out spam.

For our product backlog please refer to our wiki. Upcoming features include:

- User authentication
- A calendar view
- Exporting events to a third party calendar
- Support for recurring events
- Voting/liking system
- An admin portal for moderation
- A system for recommendations and "trending" content

Finally please help us by sharing with the open source community, friends and family.
